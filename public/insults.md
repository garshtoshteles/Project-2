You're about as much use as a condom machine in the Vatican.
Some people were dropped on their head as children. You must have been thrown at the wall.
You need me to be mean to you because even your enemies can't stand talking to you.
Your friends merely tolerate you.
Anyone who ever loved you was wrong.
You're a perfect "before" picture.
I treasure the time we spend apart.
Your parents must be so ashamed.
You spend all this time on the computer because you're so deeply rejected by society.
I miss having not known you.
You know, you should slip into something that would be more comfortable. How about a coma?
You turn stomachs, not heads.
You have the tact of a brick and the depth of a shot glass.
Who ties your shoes for you in the morning?
You're the scum at the bottom of the gene pool.
These aren't insults; they're descriptions.
Don't get down on yourself; there are plenty of other worthless people out there.
How'd you get on the computer, did someone leave your cage unlocked?
No need to say anything, smooth-brain.
You're not totally useless - you can be used as a poor example.
I've met people like you before. The psych ward is an interesting place.
The trash gets picked up tomorrow - you should get ready.
